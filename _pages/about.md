Born in Madrid. I am a Senior HPC engineer that has built HPC systems and created algorithms that need an HPC to run. Passionate about Science. I started to build clusters and HPC codes as part of my final career project. I have worked with many different languages (FORTRAN, C, C++, Python) and frameworks (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA). And different administration tools (PBS, SLURM, SGE) and OS (Linux, Windows, Solaris), and yes, I am that old.

In the early stages of my career I was working as product owner on wireless HW (TV, phone, internet). Then I did some last mile analytics, then I was offered to do a PhD. I started that path and just few months after I had to jump back again to work this time as HPC engineer.

I worked as much as I could around HPC, but sometimes I worked as SW Architect or Platform Architect, right now, I am working as a Senior HPC engineer at [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com) in Madrid. And I finish my PhD in Computational Electromagnetics in 2020 at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es).
