Born in Madrid, I am a Senior HPC Engineer with a deep-rooted passion for science. My journey into the world of high-performance computing (HPC) began during my final career project, where I first built clusters and developed HPC codes. Over the years, I have gained expertise in numerous programming languages, including FORTRAN, C, C++, and Python, as well as frameworks such as MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA. My experience spans various administration tools (PBS, SLURM, SGE) and operating systems (Linux, Windows, Solaris). And yes, I am that old.

In the early stages of my career, I served as a product owner for wireless hardware (TV, phone, internet) and dabbled in last-mile analytics. I then embarked on a PhD journey, only to return to the workforce as an HPC engineer shortly after.

Throughout my career, I have seamlessly transitioned between roles as an HPC engineer, software architect, and platform architect. Currently, I am proud to work as a Senior HPC Engineer at [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com) in Madrid. I completed my PhD  in Computational Electromagnetics in 2020 at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es), while working.
